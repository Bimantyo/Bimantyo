# 🌟 Hey, you found me!
I’m Bima — a former banker who swapped spreadsheets for Python scripts, and now I’m deep into the world of data analytics (with less paperwork and way more coffee ☕).

## 💡 For a bit of trivia

After leading high-performing teams in the banking world, I decided it was time to take my love for numbers to the next level. I jumped into a 12-week data science bootcamp where I wrestled with messy datasets, built machine learning models, and made dashboards that even my non-tech friends could understand.

## 💻 My Projects 

**🌸 [Wangi Perfume Recommender](https://github.com/Bimantyo/Wangi-Group-Project)**  

Collaborated on the development of Wangi, an AI-powered perfume recommendation app that uses 
NLP and TensorFlow to match user scent preferences with suitable products based on real customer 
reviews. Designed to enhance fragrance discovery for consumers and provide actionable insights for 
beauty brands in the Indonesian market. 

- Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seabron, Numpy, Selenium, Beautifulsoup, NLTK, 
Googletrans, Scikit-learn, Sentence Transformers, HuggingFace 

**⛅ [Weather Image Classification Using EfficientNetB0 (CNN)](https://github.com/Bimantyo/Weather-Image-Classification-Using-EfficientNetB0-CNN)**  

Developed a CNN-based model for weather image classification to support early warning systems in 
sectors like transportation and agriculture. Designed for deployment in remote areas with limited 
infrastructure, the model enables real-time, automated 24/7 weather reporting as a complementary 
solution to existing forecasts.
